Proof of Stake (POS):
The dollop blockchain is a solution with the future in mind, non resource intensive mining that creates and even playing field and allows anyone to earn from supporting the network. The dollop desktop wallet is all you need to become a dollop "Producer" and start earning new coins in real time. POS is the next step in cryptocurrency evolution which promotes true decentralization by improving accessibility, we have removed the technical and expensive POW environment to allow anyone with a modern computer to earn from supporting the blockchain.

SMARTER TECHNOLOGY
Impervious to typical attacks, the Credit blockchain completely ignores hash power and selects producers based on their balance. The absence of master nodes improves security by eliminating other forms of attack that are used in networks with fewer producers.

100% INCLUSIVE
The dollop wallet is simple to install and produces blocks automatically, anyone with a modern computer can be setup in minutes. This increases the decentralization within the node community by making it simple and accessible with no coding or advanced skills required.

FAST & FREE
Sending dollop takes seconds and is virtually free, any user can group unlimited unique transactions into a batch and send all the payments at once for the low fee of 0.00001 dollop. Transactions are confirmed quickly by the network of nodes that are rewarded with new coins rather than transaction fee's.

Innovation
The end goal of proof-of-stake (PoS) is identical to that of proof-of-work (PoW), they both seek to validate transactions and achieve network consensus. Itâ€™s just their processes that are different.

The biggest advantage that POS has over POW is that it is much less energy intensive, because hash power plays no role in success as a producer. This solidifies the decentralization of the Credit blockchain by removing equipment cost and expertise barriers which allows us to welcome literally thousands of non-technical block producers. We believe that Credit's use of POS incentives for block producers are much more aligned with our community.
